## 🎯 Task Review Data Structure

### Individual Task Review (JSON Format)

```json
{
    "task_name": "Complete Budget Report",
    "hours": 6,
    "day": "Monday",
    "original_status": "pending",
    "was_completed": true,
    "completion_comment": ""
}
```

For incomplete tasks:
```json
{
    "task_name": "System Maintenance",
    "hours": 4,
    "day": "Friday",
    "original_status": "pending",
    "was_completed": false,
    "completion_comment": "Required additional resources not available"
}
```

---

## 📊 Completion Rate Calculation

### Formula
```
Completion Rate = (Completed Tasks / Total Tasks) × 100
```

### Examples

**Example 1:**
- Total Tasks: 10
- Completed: 8
- Completion Rate: 80%

**Example 2:**
- Total Tasks: 15
- Completed: 15
- Completion Rate: 100%

**Example 3:**
- Total Tasks: 20
- Completed: 12
- Completion Rate: 60%

### Average Calculation (4-Week Period)

```
Week 1: 85%
Week 2: 90%
Week 3: 78%
Week 4: 82%

Average = (85 + 90 + 78 + 82) / 4 = 83.75%
```

## 🔐 Business Rules

1. **One Review Per Week**
   - Users can only have one review per week period
   - Unique constraint prevents duplicates

2. **Previous Week Only**
   - System automatically loads last week's tasks
   - Current week not reviewable until it ends

3. **Incomplete Task Comments**
   - Comments required for incomplete tasks
   - Helps track reasons for non-completion

4. **Submission is Final**
   - Once submitted, review cannot be edited
   - Ensures data integrity for analytics

5. **Draft Saves**
   - Users can save drafts multiple times
   - Useful for gradual completion
